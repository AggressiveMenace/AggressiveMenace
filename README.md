Hello, I am Isaac, or AggressiveMenace as nickname. I am a tech-lover from my early childhood, and profundized skills around my preteen and teen years.
I am mainly a FOSS supporter and a GNU/Linux and Unix-like "freak", but unlike many other, I'm also a fervent capitalist libertarian and pro-bussiness, sharing very in common with Eric S. Raymond's ideas about monetization.
On programming, I'm mostly familirized with C language and his libraries, but sadly I've got little background in desing of interfaces yet, for now my skills are reduced to console scripting and web development, basically.
I've got self-taughted knowledge of Unix, GNU/linux, and BSDs distros, as well as the unfamous MS Windows. Thinking on studying for some CompTIA certification and related stuff. I'm some into cybersecurity for my own, too.

That's all, for now.
