Hello, I am Isaac, or AggressiveMenace as nickname. I am a tech-lover from my early childhood, and profundized skills around my preteen and teen years.
I am mainly a FOSS supporter and a GNU/Linux and Unix-like "freak", but unlike many other, I'm also a fervent capitalist libertarian and pro-bussiness, sharing very in common with Eric S. Raymond's ideas about monetization.
On programming, I'm mostly familirized with C language and his libraries, but sadly I've got little background in desing of interfaces yet, for now my skills are limited to scripting and web development, basically.
I've got self-taughted knowledge of Unix, GNU/linux, and BSDs distros, as well as the unfamous MS Windows. Thinking on studying for some CompTIA certification and related stuff.

That's all, for now.
